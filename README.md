# HPQCJAPI
rebuild test

HPQCJAPI Syncs JUnit standard XML files into HP ALM QC.

## Usage
```
java -jar HPQCJAPI.jar [--args] Project_Name path\to\JUnitOuput.xml
```
A config.properties file is generated on your first run. It will look like this.
```
#Default properties to use for HPQCJAPI connections. Please adjust to your needs. Note that these can all be ignored with cli args. Also testSetId, testSetName, and guessTestSet are not required. TestSetId links directly to testset, name attempts to find the id matching the exact provided name, guess will simply use the tesetset folder from the last run (please mark guessTestSet with either true or false).

#Domain to connect to for ALM. Expects ALM to always be located at ${HOST}:${PORT}/qcbin
host=whqwalm02.tyson.com
# Process Team name
team=BI - BW
# Port of HP ALM server
port=80
# Whether to print debug messages
verbose=false
# Which Project Domain to use in ALM
domain=PROJECTS
# Username to connect with
username=
# Password of ALM user. Suggested to use CLI arg instead of hardcode.
password=
#Project Name
project=SR23428_EnterpriseWaterMgmtSys
# ID of folder to use
testFolder=1018
# Not Required, ID of TestSet to use. Always better to manually supply ID over using guessTestSet or TestSetName
testSetId=
testSetName=
# Attempts to guess which testSet to use. Currently just uses testSet from last succesful run
guessTestSet=true
```
These values all associate to possible command line arguments,

## Development

As a crash course, ALM Rest is built on Entities, which are collections of objects Entity. An Entity has the following schema
![Map of Schema] (http://whqlisgit02.tyson.com/is-iot-streaming/hpqcjapi/raw/development/entityschema.png)

JAXB maps these schemes to an autogenerated Entity datastructure. JUnit XSD 
Standards are also mapped to their own autogenerated datastructure. 
LinkedTestCase is the the connecting link between these two structures. It is
a manual mapping of a JUnit test case that can be linked with a design-step entity.
